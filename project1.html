<p>My project is a take on one of the most famous Renaissance paintings, The Birth of Venus by Sandro Botticelli. It’s an attempt to make a painting from 1486 into a contemporary piece of art. The use of images to create a digital collage gives it a new look and feel, in addition, the background with the pastel color palette also reinvents this artwork. The use of pink, flowers, and roses are to give it a touch of the Rococo style, I also added three Roman-like sculptures to include another one of my favorite styles, the Classical style. To finish it off, I added what appears to be a “glitch” like effect to the collage from Photomosh, making this piece with no doubt contemporary art.

My motivation behind this piece was personal, I tend to find artwork from these three styles/periods fascinating. I deeply appreciate the technique, the effort, the concept, the skill, and everything it took to make these pieces of art. Therefore, I wanted the audience to be able to still appreciate The Birth of Venus, so I created a contemporary piece that people nowadays can feel more comfortable seeing. They get the best of the old world with a mixture of the new world, they get to experience both at the same time. Augmented reality and the use of smartphones is also another great way for an audience to appreciate masterpieces nowadays, which my piece, The Rebirth of Venus encourages the audience to do.

My influence for this piece is not just Sandro Botticelli, in fact William-Adolphe Bouguereau and his interpretation of The Birth of Venus is an even greater influence to me. As a photographer who does portraiture and boudoir, paintings like these depicting Venus are an inspiration to me. The details, the realism, and the way they depict the female body are just phenomenal.</p>
