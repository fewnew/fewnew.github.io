<p>After making this art project, I wanted to create a meaningful message towards mental health. Mental health is an important issue that most people struggle with but hardly ever address it. It can also be looked at in a positive way to reflect upon the mentality of our everyday lives. I created a cool tone of background, moving images of peopleâ€™s faces, and a peaceful and surreal edit of colored images along that contributes to a symmetrical balance that your mentality is best when everything is set into place. As a result, I wanted to emphasize on a strong balance of your mental health.

Because of what goes on in our lives, we forget to remember what makes us calm and relaxed from time to time. With the flowers floating and moving, this adds on to how our thoughts could also be everywhere. Our lives could be filled with busy schedules, such as going to school, work, raising a family, and much more. I intend to send a message: at the end of the day, no matter what emotions, thoughts, or tasks that overwhelm you, everything will be okay. I also believe that a circular atmosphere of feelings and emotions help shape an experience while looking at it. As a college student that works and goes to school, everything can feel overwhelming, which brought inspiration to my project.</p>
