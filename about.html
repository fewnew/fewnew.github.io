	        	<p class="text">Softwar(e) looks poetically at the authoritarian control of information for people enduring geographical predetermination or exploitation by the opaque, algorithm-driven society. Built as a device of ubiquity, restricted access to information of the internet perpetuates inequality; an institutional perpetuation of hegemonic cultural misunderstanding. Through processes of purification and filtering, systems of control are imposed on the information that is made accessible. These interventions into the natural and localized organic growth of networks facilitating communication, define the confrontational edge between imperialization and dictatorship. Softwar(e) addresses the ways we engage and access information. It is a call to action for the development of alternative methods to circumvent the immense global influence and power.
